    Ultimate Exp / high level end game tank build. Full time power armor &amp; explosive weapons. Become unstoppable. Easily reach level 100+. SPECIAL stat &amp; prioritized perk allocation included, plus gameplay tips.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just FYI guys, I have 15 ~1 hour long episodes up of my playthrough. I've been making videos like crazy! Here's the playlist in case you want it for future reference:
   </p>
   <p>
    Introduction: This build is what I have used to dominate in a Survival mode / permadeath playthrough. It will trivialize all enemies end game and make you damn near invincible. I've tanked mulitiple hits from a Fatman late game. The goal is to get an automatic explosive weapon and buff it with Demolition Expert / Commando (or Heavy Weapons if you got insanely lucky and you're using an explosive minigun), while staying in explosive shielded power armor. We go high Int because we want to get as much exp as possible, and many of our best perks are there. We pick our other stats based on the most useful perks that are in that tree.
   </p>
   <p>
    is an excellent character builder.
   </p>
   <p>
    Starting SPECIAL:<br>
S - 3 For Armorer, needed for power armor mods. End game we max it for carry weight bonus, Strong Back, Steady Aim, and Heavy Gunner if you find an explosive minigun or wounding Gatling Laser<br>
P - 4 For Locksmith, at 5 with bobblehead we get Demolition Expert for explosive weapons<br>
E - 1 Stat dump for end game, not worth it early game<br>
C - 5 Use SPECIAL book point here for 6 Charisma, gives access to Local Leader, a must for survival. Also, Lone Wanderer (bonus still works with dogmeat as a companion). With +3 from a certain suit (from a certain quest), +1 from hat, +1 from glasses, we have 11 Charisma for bartering purposes. With Grape Mentats, +16. With a full legendary +1 cha / perc armor set (chest, leg x2, arm x2, helm)... you get the idea.<br>
I - 9 For EXP and all of the perks. We will max Medic, Gun Nut, Scrapper, Science, Chemist, and we will get 1 pt from max in Hacker, Nuclear Physicist.<br>
A - 1 Add another point here later for access to Commando. We will use automatic explosive weapons (Spray 'N Pray is guaranteed at the very least). Explosive damage on a legendary weapon is multiplied by BOTH the Demolition Expert perk AND the base weapon type perk. The best weapon type for explosive damage is automatic or a minigun (can't get on Gatling Laser). Safest bet is to go with Commando and use Spray 'N Pray. You can always put points into Heavy Gunner later if you do get an explosive minigun.<br>
L - 5 For Scrounger, Bloody Mess, Idiot Savant (yes it's worth it if you are going very high level with this build). With bobblehead (6 luck) Better Criticals. Even though we don't use VATS, it works with crits caused by Overdrive, which we have up always during combat mid - end game.<br>

    Perks by level:<br>
Level / Perk Chosen<br>
1 - None<br>
2 - Idiot Savant R1<br>
3 - Scrounger R1<br>
4 - Science R1<br>
5 - Locksmith R1<br>
6 - Save for lvl 7<br>
7 - Scrounger R2 &amp; Locksmith R2<br>
8 - Lone Wanderer R1<br>

20 - Locksmith R3 (don't get R4, not worth it, youll have a million bobby pins left over)<br>
21 - Scrapper R1<br>
22 - Save<br>
23 - Scrapper R2<br>
24 - Scrounger R3<br>
25 - Armorer R3, Gun Nut R3 (saved point from 22)<br>
26 - Nuclear Physicist R2 (Stop at R2, you'll end up dropping Fusion grenades on accident if you get R3)<br>
27 - Demolitions Expert<br>
28 - Science R3<br>
29 - 33 Demo Expert or Commando<br>
   </p><br>
   <p><br>
    You'll get as high as you can get on Demolitions Expert here, and you'll find yourself with only 1 agility, meaning that you can't take Commando. Getting the Agility bobblehead requires you to go to the literal hardest place on the map, in the south east corner at the Wreck of the FMS Northern Star. If you really wanted to min/max, you could swim there to avoid spawning the surrounding cells, but it would take a LONG time and I don't think it's worth it. You could also ignore the perk for now and get something else, like Chemist, but you'll still end up with the same problem later, as this will be literally the absolute last place in the commonwealth that we go. Personally, I'm choosing to just put a point in Agility here. This will have no effect on the build, as we will still want to max Agility end game and pick up some of the perks there. It just means that you'll have one less point in Commando picked up here, that you need to make up later.<br>
   </p><br>
   <p><br>
    34 - Idiot Savant R3<br>
35 - Demolitions Expert or Commando<br>
36 - Demolitions Expert or Commando<br>
37 - Save<br>
38 - Save<br>
39 - Armorer R4 &amp; Gun Nut R4<br>
40 - Lone Wanderer R3 &amp; Scrapper R3<br>
41 - Science R4<br>
42 - 48 Demo Expert / Commando as high as you can get them, then Pick from the following: Bloody Mess, Medic, Chemist, Cap Collector, Hacker (up to R3, do not max)<br>
49 - Commando R5<br>
50 - Lone Wanderer R4<br>
51 - 58 Max out the remaining from Bloody Mess, Medic, Chemist, Cap Collector, Hacker (up to R3, do not max)<br>
Build is basically done here and will easily wreck anything in the game, but there are certainly points that can boost the character more, but they are mainly for more hp / sprinting more etc.<br>
59 - 81 - Max out Str &amp; Endurance (make sure to get bobbleheads for one point of each). Pick up Strong Back (I go up to R3 for hauling thousands of water at a time to DC via a vertibird to buy mass shipments mid game), Steady Aim (max), Adamantium Skeleton (Max), Soloar Powered (R1) on the way.<br>
82 - 97 - Max out Agility for the AP (mainly for sprinting) and pick up Action Boy (max), Moving Target (max), and Quick Hands (R1).<br>
If / when you get the Luck bobblehead, feel free to also max out Better Criticals. You only benefit from this when you have Overdrive active or you use VATS, but we have overdrive up most of the time from mid game on.<br>
Other perks to consider at end game: Life Giver, Chem Resistant, Strong Back R3-R5, Rooted, Pain Train, Robotics Expert (if you have Automatron DLC).<br>

    Tips/Gameplay
   </p>
   <p>
    Pick up everything in the vault. Fill empty bottles with water from drinking fountain in vault - this water is purified. Go to Sanctuary. Scrap everything except for workbenches, empty bottles (can fill with dirty water, used later), and pre-war money (can be used as alternative currency, store in a container, not workshop, if you don't want to accidentally use it as cloth), and weapons that have mods. SLEEP. Don't start building yet, make sure you are well rested for buff. Build a workshop / bedroom for yourself and move all crafting workbenches into it along with a bed and one or two storage containers to store stuff outside of workshop if needed. You should have mats for 2 Industrial Water Purifiers and 4-5 small generators. Get those purifiers going. Keep the "Aid" section of your workshop relatively clear (there is a bug that will prevent water being placed in it if there is too much there). You should have ~60 purified water deposited into your workshop every 24-48 in game hours. Far more than you need. Put the excess into a container for use later / to sell. Cook some food, but don't use up squirrel. You'll want to save Squirrel for the Squirrel Stew, which bosts exp, but needs carrot which you don't have most likely. Clear out the area to the north and west of Sanctuary. There is a set of power armor, 3 fusion cores, a fatman, a mininuke, and some other stuff at the Robotics Disposal Grounds to the northeast. Kill / loot Radstags for meat. Grilled Radstag increases carry weight further. Very useful. Do not eat when hungry - you won't get bonus. Grab any Mirelurk eggs that you can. Use Dirty water to make them into omelletes. These will fill you up with a single unit, and only weigh .1. Best food for survival. Craft the following chems when you can: Bufftats, Psychobuff, Overdrive, and Psychojet. With rank 4 chemist, you can have the first 3 active all the time, and use Psychojet in big fights / emergencies, although it is somewaht overkill. Refreshing Beverage is your "oh shit" heal item. It will heal you extremely fast and cleanses rads / addictions. Always have a few on hand for emergencies. Med-X is also great, especially for enemies that use poison, however you have to use it BEFORE you get poisoned to benefit from the resistance. Also, doesn't seem like you can heal while poisoned - healing effects are applied after poison is done. This can make certain enemies like Bloodbugs, Mirelurk Hunters / Queens, and other poisoning enemies very dangerous. If you see one, pop a med-x. Only eat food that does not give rads that you have crafted. Don't even pick up pre war food, it will just clutter up your inventory / take up weight. If you need Glowing Fungus for antibiotics, there are 8-10 in the cave below / behind Red Rocket.

    At level 10-11, you can do concord. Bring your Fatman, a mininuke, a pimped out pipe rifle, and of course power armor. When that Deathclaw shows up, give him an express ticket to hell with your Fatman. Glorious. Save the minutemn. Do the quests up to Corvega, but don't go to Corvega yet. Clear out in a radius with Sanctuary as your main base. Do the quest to unlock Abernathy Farms, and set them up. Get some radio recruitment things set up, and establish supply lines between your settlements. Supply lines should be connected in one big line. It doesn't matter if it zig-zags all over the map, as long as it's a continuous line. This gives all settlements access to all other settlements workshops when crafting. Kill, loot, deposit junk / weapons, repeat. Keep an eye out for Mutfruit and Corn. We will use Mutfruit, Corn, Tatos, and purified water to make Vegetables Starch (adhesive), which we will need a lot of while gearing up. It also gives excellent exp. Ideally you want a large farm with 60-100 total food with an even spread of each of hte 3 plants, and a few carrots (to make Squirrel stew). Keep in mind that you need defense = to your food + water at each settlement to have a low chance of being raided. Having to run back to defend your settlement halfway across the map is a real pain. There are two other fusion cores in this area - one in USAF Olivia, and one in the Concord Civic Access (where the Deathclaw comes out of in Concord).

    At level 20 or so, you should have cleared a rough square in the top left corner of the map, with Sanctuary being the top left corner and Corvega being just outside of the Bottom Right corner. You should also have come across Starlight Drive-in and have it set up. This will be our staging point for our next bit of exploration. Set it up, supply line it, plant crops, etc. Now we proceed into Lexington and clear it out. It will take several trips to clear it of all baddies and get all loot. When it's clear, go ahead and clear out Corvega and get Ten Pines Bluff. Set it up. You can explore a bit east / south of Ten Pines, just don't go too far. Also, go to Sunsine Tidings Co-op, clear it, set it up, clear south / east of it. You should now have cleared a square of the top left corner of the map up to and including Lexington.

    Depending on how thorough you've been, you'll be level 25-30 at this point. Proceed into Cambridge and clear it, hook up with the BoS, do their quests. Keep exploring further east / south. Try to be level 35-40 before entering downtown Boston. We want these cells to spawn the max level enemies that they can, which seems to be in the 35-40 level range. Keep clearing, doing quests, and expanding your supply lines. Once you've done the BoS questline and are ready, do your main quest to go find Kellog and all that, to unlock the Prydwen. Now you have Vertibird grenades to use as fast travel. Join the Railroad if you want and do their quests. Kill, loot, dump gear at settlement, repeat. Set up The Castle with 10 million water purifiers and set up level 3 or 4 shops with caps invested. You can get about 1100 water per 48 hours doing this, from just The Castle. Sell your water to your vendors for about 7,000 caps per day. Put excess water into a separate container. When you get 4000+ purified water saved up, call down a vertibird, haul it all into Diamond City, and sell it over several days, refreshing the vendors several times to buy all the chems, shipments, and whatever else you want. A few trips like this and you'll have unlimited building materials for the rest of the game. Eventually you can mass produce Jet / Jet Fuel and sell that as well. When you have done all the quests you want, have all the settlements with max settlers, and you've basically made survival mode your bitch, finish the main quest in the way that you see fit. Then do Automatron / Far Harbor. After all of that, you'll probably be level 130+, and you'll be weary of the needy settlers and the life of the Minutemen General.. or whatever faction you went with. In any case, go to Nuka-World and enslave the commonwealth with the raiders. Settlers turn into slaves. Basically, become Neegan from The Walking Dead. Live out your days as the ruler of the commonwealth. Or just kill all the raiders at Nuka World if you want to be a good guy.
